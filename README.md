Hi ! 
This repository includes utilized codes while making PID Line Follower Robot. 
In this project, we used an Arduino Nano, Pololu 8-A Sensor, L298N Motor Driver and DC Motors.
First code which named " PID Line Follower Code" is the main code that you will use. PID values, PIN numbers, motor speeds could vary for each robot, so we recommend you to consider changing these values.   
Second code which named " QTR 8-A Example " is mostly same with the code given in this link "https://github.com/pololu/qtr-sensors-arduino/tree/master/examples/QTRAExample", which can also found in the "qtr-sensors-arduino" repository. We only changed the PIN numbers and the number of sensors. 
Hope you find this useful !
